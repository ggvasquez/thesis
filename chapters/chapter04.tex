\section{NA64 experiment}
The NA64 experiment is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS combining the active beam dump and missing energy techniques to search for rare events.\\
A fully hermetic detector placed on the H4 beam line has been built with the primary goal to search for light dark bossons (Z') from dark sector that are coupled to photons, e.g. dark photons (A'), or sub-GeV Z' coupled only to quarks. In some cases the Z' is coupled only to $\mu$ or tau, so we call the Z' the dark leptonic gauge boson. The experiment is also capable to search for $K_L \rightarrow $invisible decay, which is complementary to $K+\rightarrow \pi^+ + \nu \nu$, and invisible decays of $\pi_0$, $\eta$,$\eta'$, $K_S$ mesons.\\
The advantage of this approac is that the sensitivity (or number of signal events) of the experiment is roughly proportional to the Z' coupling squared $\varepsilon^2$, associated with the Z' production in the primary interaction in the target/ While in a classical beam dump experiment, it is proporiotional to $\varepsilon^4$, one $\varepsilon^2$ came from the Z' production, and another $\varepsilon^2$ is either from the probability of Z' decays or their interactions in a detector located at a large distance from the beam dump.\\ 
The sensitivities of these two methods depend on the region under study in the ($\varepsilon^2$,$m_Z$) parameter space, background level for a articular process, available beam intesity, etc.\textcolor{red}{[Beam intensity]} In some cases, much less running time and primary beam intensity are required to observe a signal event with our approach.\\
