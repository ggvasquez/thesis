	The increased necessity of experimental proof of physics beyond Standard Model (SM) and Dark Matter theories leads us
	to develop new detectors for high energy experiments, such as ATLAS with its upgrade (New Small Wheel project in
	particular), for the luminosity increase at LHC and a new experiment on SPS facilities at CERN called NA64; to search
	for Dark Matter on invisible (visible) decays of dark photons.\par
		For these two experiments, detectors from the Physics department of the University Santa Maria
in Valparaiso (Chile)	have been built to be part on such enterprise.
	Characterizations and tests have been conducted with the use of particles beam (electrons, pions, muons and gamma rays) from the Experimental Area at CERN.\par
